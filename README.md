# Project Luminous

This is my first project in Unity.



# Why I made it this way

I wanted to learn unity in as little time as possible

My main interests were AR and VR, I don't have a VR Headset, and AR seemed pretty complex to learn for my very first project

I decided to begin with something more approachable that still had something in common with my real goal, something that would allow me to learn skills that would be useful even for AR/VR applications.



## What I wanted to learn

- Making 3D environments work in Unity
- Making 3D objects for this environment, that would react in some way to the actions of the player
- How to create interactions for both the player and the other entities of the game
- Making a multi-scene project work
- How to create and manage assets that need to feel consistent with each other.



## The Game (you just lost)

The closest thing obviously was a First Person Game.

I thought that a shooter would be a good place to start, because the logic behind shooting projectiles to me felt substantially easier to understand than a combat system akin to other action games (such as Zelda or Dark Souls)

The gameplay would consist of moving in a 3D environemt and fighting the enemies, the goal is to reach a specific room alive.



## The Style

I decide to self impose a specific challenge, I would make ALL the assets (at least the visual ones) by myself

It doesn't sound as bad if you consider that I already had some decent experience with blender
