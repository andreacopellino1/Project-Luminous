# Project Luminous

This is my first project in Unity.

# Why I made it this way

I wanted to learn unity in as little time as possible

My main interests were AR and VR, I don't have a VR Headset, and AR seemed pretty complex to learn for my very first project

I decided to begin with something more approachable that still had something in common with my real goal, something that would allow me to learn skills that would be useful even for AR/VR applications.

## What I wanted to learn
The closest thing obviously was a First Person Game.

A shooter would be a good place to start
